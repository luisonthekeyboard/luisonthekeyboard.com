[Will, back in August](http://williamgill.de/2011/08/13/the-most-important-career-skill-for-this-century-fixing-whats-broken/), 15 days after I joined Nokia.

I relate so much to this idea; I can't really think of another way of working as an Engineer than to fix whatever is broken, whenever that is possible.

Engineers fix things. Engineers solve problems, enable functionality. We don't stop because it's a different language or because our problem is from a different domain.

We take the bull by the horns and are brave.
