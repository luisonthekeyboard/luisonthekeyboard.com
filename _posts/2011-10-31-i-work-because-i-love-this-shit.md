Tomorrow, it'll be three months since I joined Nokia, which reminded me how much I fucking love my work.

Being a Software Engineer is pretty much the best works ever.

Doing it at Nokia, with so many new learning oportunities, with such cool colleagues as I have, and with so much freedom and trust being put on me, is just taking something amazing and making it better.

And if all goes well, in three months I'l be permanent here.

:-)
