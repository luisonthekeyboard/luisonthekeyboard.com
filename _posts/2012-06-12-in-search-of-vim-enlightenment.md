To be honest I'm not really searching for [vim](https://www.vim.org/) enlightenment. I'm looking to switch to a text editor I can call my own. Since I have a tendency to go back to the classics, my two contenders would always have to be `vim` and `emacs`. Vim, however, is by default available on all operating systems, on all default linux installations, and therefore will where I start this adventure.

In my path for vim enlightenment, just came across a [blog post by Yann Esposito](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/), which shows just the very reason why this editor is so fucking powerful.

Two other articles followed and I think they are essential for anyone learning vim:

- one is a story about [how Jon Beltran de Heredia started using Vim](http://blog.ngedit.com/2005/06/03/the-vi-input-model/ "the vi input model");
- the second is an article quoted by Jon -- [Efficient editing with vim](http://robertames.com/files/vim-editing.html "efficient editing with vim"), written by Jonathan McPherson (could not find the original).

I think these are probably the most readable and immediately useful articles I ever read about vim.

Final curiosity note, [vim was born on November 2nd 1991](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/11/two-decades-of-productivity-vims-20th-anniversary/), 1 day after I became 11 years old.

Let's hope I get used to this _mode switching_ thing and in 11 years I'm still using it as my main driver!
