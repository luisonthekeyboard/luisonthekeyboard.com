> One thing about eBooks that most people haven’t thought much is that eBooks are the very first thing that we’re all able to have as much as we want other than air.

[Michael S. Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_S._Hart) the inventor of the ebook and the founder of [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org), passed away last Tuesday, September 6th.

I think I've been a bigger fan of ebooks than I am now.

When I was in university, I really thought that ebooks were the answer to universal access to knowledge. As time has passed on, I think the fact that they are as available as air reduces their value.

I am uncertain about this _high availability_ of everything, from books, to cameras, to publishing means; or perhaps more accurate, I am uncertain about how much most people can actually make good use of this high availability.

I think ebooks are a good example of something which, because it is so available, easily falls in disuse and is completely wasted.

Great times we're living in, where matters are no longer black and white.
