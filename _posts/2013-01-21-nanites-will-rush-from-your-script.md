> You and the machine together will run this latest Ruby script, the product of your obsession.
> 
> And the script will fire up chainsaws to trim the trees, hearths to warm and regulate the house. Builder nanites will rush from your script, reconstructing your quarters, retiling, renovating, chroming, polishing, disinfecting. Mighty androids will force your crumbling house into firm, rigid architecture. Great pillars will rise, statues chiseled.

> You will have dominion over this palatial estate and over the encompassing mountains and islands of your stronghold.

[Why](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff)'s (poignant) guide to ruby is one of the funniest texts Iâ€™ve ever read by a computer guy. Clever, technical and it has talking animals.

I kind of lost interest in Clojure, even though I really liked what I read about functional programming. Maybe I'll get back to it someday but right now I wanted a language that would let me be productive really fast.

Ruby seems to be that language. It's very _fluid_ and code just comes out very naturally, whatever I'm doing. Feels a bit low-level sometimes, more so than Javascript at least, and feels a bit saner in terms of types.

Let's see where this trip will take me to.
