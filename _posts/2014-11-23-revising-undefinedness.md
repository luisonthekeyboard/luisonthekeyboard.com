It was a strange set of coincidences that led me to search for the [LaTeX source code of my master's thesis](https://github.com/decomputed/revisingUndefinedness).

Written between late 2005 and October 2006, I think this is the individual contributor work I have done of which I am most proud of. Not so much of the academic importance of the thesis but more of the work process, of having had a huge fucking problem to solve, of which I knew close to nothing, and having solved it within a year of work.

I attacked this problem with little formal mathematical and logic programming training, apart from some post-graduation classes and loads of curiosity. I did not know how to approach a formal proof, or what a lemma is. And at the same time I was teaching in two portuguese universities and trying to start [a company](http://www.sporttools.org/) with some friends.

Looking back, I cannot really say if I was brave or stupid in taking this challenge. The end result was certainly good - 17 out of 20 and a great feeling of pride.
