Lateral thinking has brought me here.

Here I am, thinking about all the problems I'll have by adding a database to my blogging engine, the biggest one being that people won't be able to just download the blogging engine and use it, out of the box.

They'll also have to download a copy of the database and set it up. And then I'll need to keep up with versions and scripts to create a schema.

And so I thought “what if I just ditch the database”?

On a side note, the picture above is exactly how I still imagine databases. Lot's of little men and women running around and fixing actual computers. Inside my own computer.

Ultimately a blog engine has to be just something that reads Markdown files and outputs HTML pages.

Simple, low abstraction level, and easy to extend.
