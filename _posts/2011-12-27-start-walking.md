> Someone once asked Yunmen Wenyan, - How can I find the Way? He replied, - Start walking.

I've been reading Zen Baggage, a book where [Bill Porter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Pine_%28author%29) describes a pilgrimage through sites associated with the first six patriarchs of Zen.

It's mostly a very historical book, filled with some personal passages, almost like a travel diary. But every now and then, there's a little gem of some Buddhist monk which relates so well to everyday life.

_The Way_, in Yunmen Wenyan's conversation, refers to the way to enlightenment, but it can easily be adapted to the way to your career, the way to fulfillment.

I think the main idea here (and indeed, in Buddhism) is that no one can tell you how to find the Way - you have to walk your own path and find your own way through experience.

As an old professor and a good friend of mine once told me:

> You can't live life through other people's experiences.
