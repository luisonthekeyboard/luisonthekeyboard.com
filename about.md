Welcome! I'm Luis and I've been writing about my work as a Software Engineer and a Tech Lead since 2007, give or take a couple of years.

Here you can find most of my thoughts and experiences, and how they've been affecting me throughout all these years.

Many things I've written represent the core of my values and character, so if you want to know me better, maybe start with these articles:
-   [It\'s very difficult to be complete](/2017/11/07/the-balance-you-must-strike-as-a-tech-lead.html)
-   [My Values as a Tech Lead](/2017/08/17/my-values-roughly.html)
-   [How I decide when to leave my jobs](/2014/12/29/when-should-you-leave-your-job.html)
-   [Testing as part of a Software Engineer\'s job](/2011/03/28/so-what-do-you-think-about-testing.html)

There's still many things to say about this work happening between Engineering and Management. I have countless articles half-written in paper, notes, things I started but never ended... eventually all of it will find its way in here!

Hope you enjoy the reading!
